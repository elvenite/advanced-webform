# TODO
## Elements can be
	* [x] hidden - completely invisible, not in the html source
	* [x] locked - just display their value, but not in a input element
	* should an app reference field be an autocomplete or extended?
	* [x] display * on required elements

## Javascript
	* Show progress-slider value to the right
	* date and timepicker?

## Error handing

# BUGS
* linebreaks are removed from podio, nl2br?
* If app element is locked, don't display Files placeholder
* If app element is locked, better display of values
