# Advanced Webform for Podio
This is an extension library to the Podio PHP library, it generates a form based on a Podio App ID and optionally an Item ID.

**Disclaimer:** This is a work in progress and the API can change at any time.
Once we reach a stable version, semantic versioning will be used.

# Installation
## Composer Install

Install composer in your project:

    curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

Create a `composer.json` file in your project root:

    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "vcs",
            "url": "https://github.com/elvenite/advanced-webform"
        }
    ],
    "require": {
        "elvenite/advanced-webform": "master"
    }

Install via composer:

    php composer.phar install

Add this line to your application's `index.php` file:

    <?php
    require 'vendor/autoload.php';

Advanced Webform requires the [Podio PHP library](https://github.com/podio/podio-php). Default CSS uses Bootstrap 2.3.2 but you can change the decorators to fit your own CSS framework.

# Initialize the form
To load the form elements from the desired Podio App, initialize the class:

    $form = new \AdvancedWebform\AdvancedWebform(array(
        'app_id'		=> APP_ID, // an int value with your desired Podio App
		// 'app'		=> $app, // Optional, If you already loaded the app from PodioApp::get you can reference it like this
        // 'item_id'	=> $item_id, // Optional, to have the form update an existing item, include the item id
		// 'item'		=> $item, // Like the $app attribute, the result from a PodioItem::get($item_id) 
    ));

## Other attributes

* lock_default (true|false)
* method ("POST"|"GET")
* action (url)
* submit_value (The text on the submit button, defaults to "Submit")

## Set element attributes in description
Each Podio app field has a description, you can use the description to easily add different attributes to single elements.

Example: "[hidden] This field will be hidden in the Advanced Webform"

More attributes in the description:

* hidden (no value, hides the field)
* locked (no value, locks the field, but still visible and any value will be submitted to Podio)
* required (true|false, override default setting)
* value (example: [value=This will be the predefined value in the element]
* maxsize (int, maximum allowed characters in the element
* practically any html attribute, autofocus etc

### Special attributes
The App reference field will expand to display all elements of the first referenced app making it possible to insert values in several apps using a single form.
If you rather what to select an existing item, set a view attribute to the description. Example: [view=12345] where 12345 is the id of a saved view for the referenced app.
This makes it possible to show a subset of items instead of all like the regular Podio web form does.

# Save the form
	if ($_POST){
		$form->set_values($_POST, $_FILES);
		if (!$form->save()){
			$error_message = $form->get_error();
		}
	}

# Display the form
Just echo the the form object:
        echo $form;

# Known issues
* linebreaks are removed from podio, nl2br?

* If app element is locked, don't display Files placeholder

* If app element is locked, better display of values

* Right now, sub_forms are saved at set_value which is bad. It's better to do it
at \AdvancedWebform\AdvancedWebform->save(). Save() needs to iterate on all sub form save
methods.

# TODOs?
* CSRF protection
* should an app reference field be an autocomplete or extended?
* Show progress-slider value to the right
* date and timepicker?
* Add calc field
* Better documentation inside code, PHPDoc style
* Describe item fields vs app fields
* Explain field name prefix
* Unit tests
* Support for Podio PHP Library version 4
* Handle file upload errors
* Documentation section gh-pages for more extended documentation
    * decorators
    * how to do validation, pre-save checks etc
